## NOSQL VS SQL

1)
    SQL             NoSQL

- SQL databases are called Relational databases   whereas NoSQL database are called non-relational or distributed database.
- SQL databases are table based whereas noSql databases are document based, key-value pairs or graph database
- SQL has a large support basis however noSql is primarily community driven so there limited support
- SQL databases use structured query language whereas Nosql database queries are focused on collection of documents 

2)open sourced or closed sourced data is a good fit for SQl

3)A good example of this would be customer information, and product information

4)NoSQl stores graph databases key-value, document store databases.

5)a good example is accessing a large volume and variety of data

6)NoSql would be the best fit for hierarchical data storage

7)NoSql is a better fit for scalability. both SQL and noSQl are able to increase in scale Nosql requires serves to increase the scalability whereas SQl you would have to replace hardware in order to increase the scalability.


## SQL vs NoSQL

1) Structured Query Language

2)A relational database works with assuming that the information is related to each other in some way.

3)A relation database works with a table structure 

4)A schema is a logical structure for data

5)A NoSQL database is a large collection of data

6)The database can be set up like a table but the information doesn't have to follow the table like structure and information can be missing or different. Theres no Schema or relations

7)MongoDB doesnt need relations for the database instead everything is stored together usually in a JSON format

8)it depends on the application and data storage, if you need something more strict utilizing schemas then SQL is best, however if you need data that doesnt need structure then NoSQL is best.

9)depending on your usage not have a schema can be a disadvantage as well as not having any relations so you'd have to update everything manually/individually.
