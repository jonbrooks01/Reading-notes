# Class 09 Reading Notes

## Functional Programming Concepts

1) Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs

2) a pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects

3) The benefits for a pure function are that the codes easier to test, like give parameter A -> then expect the function to return value B

4) Immutability is a state that cannot change after its created, since you cant change the object you would have to create a new one.

5) Referential transparency is combining pure functions with immutable date to create a referential transparency.

1) a module is another file instead of having all the code in one file.

2) require is able to pass a file in the folder to another file using (./(file name)) 

3) we set that module equal to a variable so that we can use the function for the file in our current file

4) we have to export that module in the file and then use require with a variable in the file that we want to bring that module into.
