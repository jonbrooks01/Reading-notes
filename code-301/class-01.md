# Class 01 Reading Notes


## Component-Based Architecture

1) A component is a functional software element that is reusable and self-deployable.

2) The characteristics of a component are;

- Reusability, they can be used in different situations in different applications

- Replacable, component can be replaced with other components

- Not text Specific, components can operate in different environments and contexts

- Extensible, a component can extend from different components to provide new behavior

- Encapsulated, a components do not expose the internal process or variables or the state

- Independent, components dont need to depend on other components  

3) The advantages of using components are;

- Ease of deployment, components can be easily adapted to newer versions without impact to the system as a whole.

- Reduced cost, the use of third party components spreads the cost of maintenance and developments.

- Reusable, They can be usable across many different applications, spreading the cost of maintenance and development.

- Modifications of technical complexity, a component can change the complexity through the component container.

- Reliability, The overall system is more reliable since each component is able to be reused

- System maintenance and evolution, components are easy to change and update without affecting the entire system.

- Independent, components are independent of each other which makes it easier to be more productive for future software development.


## What is Props and How to Use it in React

1) props is short for properties and is being used to pass data from one component to another.

2) to use a prop in react first it must have an attribute and have data to send, then the data passes to the child components and then finally the data is rendered.

3) The flow of props goes from the parent to the child and then has the possibility to extend to the next child if need be.
