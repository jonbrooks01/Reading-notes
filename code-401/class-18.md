# Class 18 Reading Notes

## AWS API Gateway Overview

1) AWS API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic

2) API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Serverless function directly in response to an HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups

3)

- AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
- AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
- Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

## AWS API Gateway

1) Benefits using API Gateway include efficient API development, performance at any scale and easy monitoring

2) Two types of API's are RESTful API's and WEBSOCKET API'S

## AWS DynamoDB Guide 

1) DynamoDB is hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)

2) I would use DynamoDB when using AWS Lambda

## AWS DynamoDB

1)

## Dynamoose

1) Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose

2) Key Features of Dynamoose include; Type Safety, High level API, Easy to syntax nad callback and promise support

## Reflection

I would like to be able to integrate API Gateway and DynamoDB when using AWS Lambda succesfully and able to recreate the results on my own.
