# The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

Deliberate practice is the idea that you practice what you dont know/understand so that you can challenge yourself and learn new things i.e "the growth mindset". Focusing on what you do know and being complacent in those things doesn't make you a better software developer or a better person. Its the times when you struggle through something that really develop your skills and help you learn new concepts.

## Emotional Intelligence 

- I still need to improve on my social awareness, however it has improved since taking this assessment the last time.

- My Self-Management and Self-Awareness are my strongest, however I can still use some improvement in those areas.

I would say overall my emotional intelligence has improved since last class, however these is still room for improvement and I hope I can improve these areas in this class.

## Assessing Bias

- My strongest areas are Meaningful connections and Connect to Mitigate Bias. I plan to use these areas to help with the areas I am weaker at.

- I recognize that i need some self improvement in empathy and curiosity. I plan to strengthen this as well as effective encouragement towards others.
