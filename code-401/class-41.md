## Getting Started with React Native

1) Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

- <View> A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls
- <ScrollView> A generic scrolling container that can contain multiple components and views
- <Text> Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events

3) What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)? React Native is able to view IOS and Andriod development in javaScript instead of Swift or Kotlin. Your able to make apps look and feel the same way with Native. 

4) What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app? The building blocks of React Native are very similar to React they both have components, JSX, Props and State. 
   
## Expo

1) What solution does expo provide?  Expo brings together the best of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and scaling an app such as live updates, instantly sharing your app, and web support.

2) Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the manage workflow.

3) What is the difference between React Native and Expo? The expo package provides a suite of features that make it easier to develop, and scale complex React Native applications. You can install expo in nearly any React Native app. The expo package is not required to use Expo Application Services (EAS) or React Native, however, it is highly recommended. 

## Expo Snack

1) Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do? Snack allows you to view your application on the different platforms such as Android and IOS.

   
## Ejecting

1) What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo? where you jump between workflows and move into the bare workflow, where you can continue to use Expo APIs but have access and full control over your native Android and iOS projects.

2) When should you not eject? You should not eject if you dont have a firm understanding of the build configuration so you can manipulate the bare workflow 

3) Why might you choose to eject? If you want to change the workflow of the application and have full control over the IOS project.


## Additional Questions

1) Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning? I look forward to learning about react native and expo and being able to create an application

2) What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README? get a clear understanding of react native and how to utilize it within my apps.
