# Class 01 Reading Notes

## An Introduction to Node.js

1) Node is an open sourced project that helps run code more efficiently and asynchronously. Node helps run code more efficiently because it can handle multiple requests at once without getting bogged down. for example it can handle 5 different tasks at the same time, determine what tasks are easier to complete and complete those while still working on the rest of the tasks given.

2) Node is able to serve as a program on the users computer and efficiently run code that can execute to the outside world. It is not dependent on the browser to run code.

3) Node is a modern javascript landscape and many frameworks that are available run on node to effectively work especially modern frameworks like React and Angular.

## Additional Questions

1) I look forward to learning more about React/Redux and how to develop applications in this environment more effectively.

2) I look forward to understand Node and developing applications that are deployed to the cloud.
