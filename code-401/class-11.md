## Event Driven Programming

1) The native node.js module that allows us to get started with the event driven programming is the events module.

2) The value of object oriented programming when used in tandem with event driven programming is that with these two paired together, it makes programming easier to connect two object together without linking them in code, by using an event in one object it can trigger the function from the other object making it more modular.

3) Event driven programming will be useful in back-end developments especially with tieing objects together. If you wanted to say to someone that you acknowledged there reply on a post an event could be triggered where you could send an auto reply with a set message, or even you would receive a notification of that post so you can go in an reply without constantly having to check.
