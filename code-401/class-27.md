# Class 27 Reading Notes

## Thinking in React

1)

- Step 1: Split the items on the webpage into similar components

- Step 2:Build a basic version of the webpage

- Step 3: Make the UI interactive, Identify which items are state vs props

- Step 4: Build state into the webpage

- Step 5: Add the dataflow into the static webpage

## State: A Componentâ€™s Memory

1) local variables don't update between renders.

2) Index and setIndex

3) the information would get passed to a common parent and then that parent would share the component to the children

## Reflection

1) I would like to learn how to use hooks with react components to make things easier to read and function
