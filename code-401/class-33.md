# Class 33 Reading Notes

## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

1) RBAC restricts access to a network or a certain area unless they have the correct permissions to have access

2) Some examples would be a main contact for an account, technical roles for troubleshooting, billing roles for payments and admin roles for personnel.

3) RBAC can make a company more efficient and have less paperwork to handle when a employee get promoted the company can restrict/raise there access instead of creating new profiles. RBAC makes organizational structure align with the companies roles.

## React-Cookies Component

1) react-cookie has the ability to perform CRUD tasks making things more efficient

2) react-cookies is able to save the information about the cookies and can save certain information about a user similar to RBAC.

3)React-cookie seems like its straight forward, however cookies seems like it has a lot more usage. I would probably use cookies more after learning about it.
