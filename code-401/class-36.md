# Class 36 Reading Notes

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials

1) The first principal of Redux is your going to use a single object for state.

2) Store is able to save the applications state and use built in methods to update the state with reducers.

3)

- subscribe: is used to add event listeners so they can trigger an action to update state

- dispatch: sends an action to the state to update it

- getState: is used to retrieve the current state.

4)The combineReducer built in method is similar to bouquet, there are many flowers that make up an arrangement each having its own different shape and size. The combine reducer takes each flower and put it together to form an arrangement that combines all the flowers together.

## Additional Questions

1) I look forward to learning more about redux and being able to implement it into my own react projects.

2) Being able to use redux in a project effectively.
