# Class 26 Reading Notes


## React Quick Start

1) The building blocks of react apps are components

2) HTML tags start with a lower case, however react components start with a capital letter

3) JSX is a stricter syntax then HTML, we use it because its convenient and a lot of tools support JSX

4) the main difference is that you cant return multiple components with JSX you have to put them in a wrapper "<> </>"

5) There is no special syntax for writing conditions you can use the if else statements or use the conditional ? operator for iterations. In addition if you don't need the else statement you don't have to include it.

6) for handling user input you need to import the useState library and then you don't need to call event handlers just need to pass them down.

7) Functions starting with use are utilizing a hook.

8) set the state to the parent function and then pass it down to the children.

## Render and Commit

1)

- Triggering a render (delivering the guestâ€™s order to the kitchen)
- Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
- Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

2)You can update the component with a set function after its initial render

3)During the initial render react will create the dom nodes and then when theres a re-render, reach will re-render if need be

4)The browser will need to repaint the screen in-order to show the changes that have been made.

## Additional Questions

1) The naming conventions are simple and they just say what the component does so there no ambiguity.

2) I'm looking forward to learning more about react and building my skills.

3) Be able to understand and grasp the information so I can create a new application.
