## Web Sockets

1) Web sockets are a similar kind of communication tool to HTTP

2)The Client first makes sa request to the server, then the server response agreeing to the handshake. Once that is complete the client and server send messages at the same time to deliver the data. Once the data transfer is complete one side closes the chanel that was used.

3)Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a request from that client.
