# Class 04 Reading Notes

## NOSQL VS SQl

1) A SQL database would be best suited for a complex query intrusive environment

2) A NOSQL database would be best suited for a hierarchical type data storage

3) An SQL database is like a bookshelf everything is in order and theres a specific place on the shelf for each book. However a NOSQL database is like a case of books you add books wherever there is room and there is no order to how they are arranged.

## SQL Modeling Techniques

1) A one-to-many relationship there is a relationship between a single point on one table and many points on another table. For example in our class is a one-to-many type relationship since we have one teacher and many students.

2)Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to draw a diagram of the database tables and their relationships.

3)A primary key is how a row is uniquely identified a table typically has one primary key however it can have more. A foreign key is a column or set of columns that matches to the primary key in another table

## SQL VS NOSQL

1) Keywords in SQL have pre-defined meanings like: SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE and DELETE whereas parameters are the values that are passed into an SQL database to improve efficiency

2) Normalization is a way to organize and structure the data in a way that minimizes the redundancy and improves on the data integrity.

3) A one-to-one relationship is like a marriage or a couple, they are connected to each other. A one-to-many relationship is like a classroom with one teacher and many students. finally a many-to-many relationship is like a football or baseball game where there are many players on either side.
