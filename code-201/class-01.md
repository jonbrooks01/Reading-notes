## How the Web Works

Websites are stored on servers that transfer the information to the client(personal laptop/phone) by the TCP/IP which then the browser that receives the data uncodes the data packet and produces the webpage that the user wants to look at.

## Website Design and Process

The First part of building a website is trying to figure out what you want that website to look like. Typically websites are drafted on either paper or something similar so that it can be changed and manipulated changing it into the website that the client will like. Once the website layout has been choosen the website will come alive with images, text, colors and finally font

## JavaScript Basics

JavaSCript is a language that can add interactivity to a website. The use can be from asking a simple question to creating a game on that webpage By using variables in JavaScript you can recall previous answer or values into new code to make thinga easier.

1)THe browser gpes to the website to request a copy
The server approves the browesr request and says"200 OK"
The server starts sending the files to the browser 
The browser assembles the website for teh user 

2) The browser parses the HTML first for the website reading the script to see if there are any links or script. Once the browser has identifiesd the links it sends a request to gather those items first CSS then Javascript. The browser will build the site with the CSS frist and then run and execute the JavaScript 

3) you can add images to a website by going to google and find that image, then copy the web address of that image and include it into a img tag in your code 

4) A string is surrond by quotes however a number is just that number no quotes needed 

5) Variables contain stored information that you can pull and use at any time throughout your code. It makes coding easier and more efficent


## Introduction to HTML

1) An attribute is extra information for that element. It is used commonly in CSS to call that particular element and chage how it appears on the webpage

2) An HTML element has two tags an opening and a closing tag. inside those tags there is the coontent what the writer wants to say. 

3) An article can be independent from the rest of the webpage and the user can understand whats inside. However the section tag inlcudes a larger sum of information. It can include several articles inside that tag as well as headlines or themes. 

4) The typical elements that a webpage will have are;

- html tag
- title tag
- head tag
- body tag
- p tag

5) The meta tag contains important information regarding the website from author information, data about the HTML and specific keywords.

## Building a Website

1) The first steps to building a website is finding out what that website will accomplish, how will that website reach my goals and what needs to be done in order to reach my goals

2) The most important question that needs to be asked when building a website is "what exactly do I want to accomplish"

## Semantics 

1) Using the H1 tag instead of the span tag will tell the website that the information provided is important, unlike a span tag it has no semantic value.

2) you can add javascript into a website by callling out that function from another file or you can input the javascript code directly into the html code

## What is JavaScript

1) The two things that require javascript in the browser are HTML and CSS in order to make the website be interactive and not static 

2) you can add java internally on the html page in a script tag, you can call JavaScript from another file and import it into the html file or you can write JavaScript directly into your code.
