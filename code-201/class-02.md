# Class 02 Reading Notes

## Introduction to HTML

- 1) It is important to use semantics in HTML because it gives structure to the webpage. It also the reader to see the webpage clearly and more importantly it a helpful tool for screen readers to know what's going on on that webpage.

- 2) There are six heading elements (h1-h6)

- 3) The 'sub' tag lowers a number or phrase below the text line and the 'sup' tag line raises number or phrase above the text line. These are used when you want to express a chemical formula or mathematical expression.

- 4) When using the 'abbr' tag the full expansion of the term must be included to provide context to the reader.

## Learn CSS

- 1) We can apply CSS to HTML in three different ways; External Stylesheet, Internal Stylesheet and Inline.

- 2) Inline style should be avoided because it makes the code very difficult to read and the tag might require several CSS changes to get it to what the writer wants.

- 3) 
- H1 is representing the selector
- The CSS declaration is "color: black" & "padding: 5px"
- The padding and color are considered the properties

## JS

- 1) A string value is surrounded by a single quote mark

- 2) 
- Strict Equals "==="
- Assignment "="
- Addition "+"
- Does not Equal "!, !=="

- 3)
- Greater then ">"
- Less then "<"
- Less Then or Equal to "<="

- 4) "&&" Allows you to chain two or more expressions together, all those expressions must be true for the whole expressions to return true. The "||" chains expressions together, however only one or more have to return true for the whole expressions to be true.
