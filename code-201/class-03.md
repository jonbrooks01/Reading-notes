# Class 03 Reading Notes

## Learn HTML

### Ordered and Unordered

1) An Unordered list tag is good to use whenever you do not need a numerical number. Unordered lists are presented in bullet points.

2) By using the type attribute the bullet points can be changed to different styles like circle, disc and square.

3) You would want to use an ordered list over an unordered list when you want the end user to read the list and do steps in sequential order, or when the list is going through step by step instructions. 

4) You can start a ordered list at a certain number with the "start" attribute, in addition you can also have the numbers reverse and countdown with the "reversed" attribute.

## Learn CSS

### The Box Model

1) Padding is like the castle wall for protection against attacks and the margin is like the moat that surrounds the castle to help prevent enemy forces from coming close 

2)

- Contents box; what the box is made for

- Padding box; space between the margins and content

- Border Box; Shows the outline of the box and how big it is
 
- Margin box; separates the box from other boxes and the edge of the website.

## Learn JS

### Arrays, Operators, Expressions and Loops

1) You can store any variable in an array from; strings, number, objects and even other arrays. 

2) The people array is a valid array with three different arrays inside it. you van access the values inside by calling the different arrays first then calling the individual items in that array i.e  'console.log(people[0][2]')

3)

- x = f() is the assignment operator
- x += f() is the addition operator
- x -= f() is the subtraction operator
- x *= f() is the multiplication operator
- x /= f() is the division operator

4) The results to the expressions would be '10dog'. Since a is equal to 10 and c is equal to a boolean 'false (0)' the answer remains 10. then when the number is added to a string the two values combine to be '10dog'

5) A real world example of a conditional statement for a conditional would be gong for a slice of pizza when you've eaten some already. If you take that slice now your going to be extra full however if you don't take the next slice of pizza you will feel satisfied and not hurting.

6) A loop is useful in JavaScript when you want the end user to write a specific message or answer. So you will continue to prompt the user over and over until they input the specific message that you want them to write.
