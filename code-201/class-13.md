## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1) A developer would use local storage for a web application because with HTTP web applications are stateless so when you edit or update an application it wont save those changes. With local storage update to web applications are stored on the locally so the next time that application is used the updates are saved and available.

2) The information that shouldn't be saved on local storage is personal information from users utilizing cookies. 

3) Local Storage can only store string only information, However you can get around this by using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to save numbers to local storage.
