# Class 10 Reading Notes


## What Went Wrong? Trouble javaScript

1) Syntax Errors are mistyped words in the code that doesn't allow the program to run properly, these will usually give an error message of some kind whereas logic errors will give no errors because the code is correct but the results will be different from what is expected.

2) The type of errors that I have experienced are not calling a function properly, missing semicolons in my function that wouldn't allow my code to run, having functions that aren't defined or calling a functions that wasn't written and expressed properly. I was able fix these errors by looking at the console and find the error locations, troubleshooting the errors by process of elimination. 

3) Troubleshooting will be apart of coding and it will help me understand how to write and learn code. By seeing code and looking for the ways that the code will function I will be able to learn new ways of writing code in an more efficient manner.

## The javaScript Debugger

1) The JavaScript Debugger tool is able to run the JavaScript portion of the code and retrieve the variables and values that are set within that code to see if the functions are running the way they are intended to run.

2) Breakpoints are manual stops that you can put inside of your code before a function starts or where you specifically what to see what will happen prior to that portion of code from running. Breaks are most useful when your running through code and a portion of that code has no errors so you can pick up where the rest of the code hasn't been checked.

3) CallStack is a way to determine how that particular line of code has been ran and what function or functions are calling that line of code.
