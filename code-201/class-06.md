# Class 06 Reading Notes


## JavaScript Object Basics

1) An object is a way to save information to recall late like a variable, however unlike a variable you can have multiple sets of variables saved within a single object.

2) You are able to call several properties using one object call.

3) Unlike an array an object can store pieces of information within different variables. Arrays can only store information in a list form.

4) When a object property name is held in a variable then using bracket notation to call that variable is better then using dot notation.

5) "this" allows you to call the variable in the object, in the example this.name produces "spot" and this.age gives "2".

## Introduction to DOM

1) Document Object Model (DOM) is the programming interface for web documents. It gives the webpage its structure from a section tag to a list tag everything is apart of the DOM.

2) The DOM structures the webpage using tags like the head, main, footer. JavaScript uses the DOM as a road so that it can interact with the webpages as intended because without it JavaScript and any other language wouldn't know where to run their code on the webpage.
