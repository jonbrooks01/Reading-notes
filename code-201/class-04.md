# Class 04 Reading Notes


## Learn HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

1) To create a Link we wrap the text within an 'a' tag.

2) The href attribute contains the URL for the 'a' tag.

3) By using descriptive words for the link text the screen readers will be able to be more informed about links on the page. 

## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal FLow, Positioning

1) Normal flow is the system which elements are presented in the browser's viewport. by default block level elements are seen in the block flow direction (vertically)

2) Block elements are displayed vertically whereas inline elements are displayed one after another as long as there is enough space for them to be displayed in the parent element.

3) Static positioning is the default for every HTML element

4) An absolute element no longer exists in the normal document flow, the element sits on its own layer separated from everything else. This is extremely useful for pop-up and ui features that require user interaction but without disrupting the webpages normal flow.

5) absolute position makes the element raise above the normal webpage flow whereas the fixed element makes that element stay in view when the user scrolls through the webpage. A useful example is a nav bar being consistent so the user doesn't have to scroll to the top of the page to change the directory. 

## Learn JS

### Functions - Reusable Blocks Of Code

1) Declaring the function is writing what the function does somewhere on the code, however invoking the function is calling the function to run in the code.

2) In functions, Parameters are what makes up a function, the create the responses that a function needs to operate, the arguments are what the user inputs into the parameters to run inside that function.

## Reasons for Pair Programming

1) Two benefits of pair programming that will help me with my coding journey will be job interview readiness and social skills. These two benefits will help me transition to finding a job as a software developer because working as a team is a crucial part of programming as well as being able to get the skills needed to pass the job interview.
