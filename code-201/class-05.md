# Class 05 Reading Notes

## HTMl Media

1) The alt attribute can be used if a image is taking to long to load or the image link is broken there still is a description of what is suppose to be seen in addition alt attributes are extremely important for screen readers so they can still understand the content of the webpage.

2) By including a detailed description of the img in the alt attribute, will help screen readers understand what the image is suppose to portray. in addition when using a decorative img make sure to leave the alt attribute empty so the screen reader doesn't have to read about about a image for styling. 

3) a figure element can wrap a image with a caption so the screen reader will know that caption is associated with the image that is being displayed. However alt attributes and fig captions shouldn't display the same information because they will both be displayed when the image is gone.

4) a gif is a animation that will play over and over again, a svg is something that will be drawn on the website, it is not an animation so it wont play over an over again it will be drawn and displayed on the webpage. 

5) I would use a PNG format to display a webpage, when compressed PNG will still display better quality image over a JPEG. However a lossless WebP is the best choice for displaying an image while compressed but it is less supported then PNG.

1) The background color shows behind the element of text, it could be displayed as a shadow or a box behind the image in a particular color. Foreground color changes the color of the actual text making the text pink or purple instead of the standard black.

2) You can add color to the different sections of the blog showing the reader that there is different content in each section, or you can change the appearance of the text to display a different font and to make it bold or underlined for significance. 

3) When using a font for a website it should be considered to use a web safe font so that the font will be displayed in any browser a user chooses. 

4) font-size changes the text size ranging from pixels to preset standards i.e "large, small". font-weight changes the text to different levels of bold depending on how bold you want that text to be. font-style changes the text's style to italic.

5) You can use the letter-spacing or word-spacing tag to create more spacing around a h1 tag or any tag.
