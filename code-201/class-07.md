# Class 07 Reading Notes


## Domain Modeling

1) Domain modeling is needed because you can create a model code for a specific problem and store information within that code in order to have that data be presented in a technical and business oriented setting to change how a program or website is viewed to the public.

## HTML

1) Using a table layout in HTML is a bad idea because of Accessibility. by using a table layout for a webpage it makes it very difficult for screen readers to understand whats going on in that webpage. In addition using a table layout instead of proper layout techniques will result in more difficult code to write maintain and debug.

2) 'table' 'colgroup' 'th' are semantic elements when dealing with making a table in html.

- table: defines a table is going to be made.

- colgroup: defines that there are separate columns inside that table.

- th gives a cell in a table a header.

## Introducing Constructors

1) using a constructor can reuse functions that are outside of an object and when called can make a new object with the revenant information, instead of writing a out a new object with the same code as others.

2) When using 'this' inside an object literal you could only target properties within that object. By using 'this' in a constructor the property is transferred to a new object in stead of referencing something that is already written.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1) Prototype is similar to Leaning out a job, instead of doing the repetitive way of doing things your able to introduce a new method and reduce the overall amount of time and energy you used to use. for example instead of starting a bolt on a nut and using a wrench at the very top it would be repetitive and unnecessary. However if you first hand tightened that bolt as much as you could and then use a wrench to tighten it the rest of the way you'll save time and reduce the repetitive motion it took when you did it the first time.
