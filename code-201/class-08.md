# Class 08 Reading Notes


## Flexbox

1) Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout which means, you cant you flexbox when you have containers that float on top of another container. Flexbox is purely for arranging a single line but can wrap to multiple lines.

2) The main difference between main axis and cross axis is that the main axis will be similar to a row. the items will start from the left side of the page and then go to the right side of the page. The cross axis is where the items start on the left side of the page but instead of going to the right side, the items will then go down like a column.

3) The biggest negative impact in regards to accessibility is when you use properties like "row-reverse/column-reverse" even though these properties will work visually, they will not work when using accessibility functions.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1) The biggest difference between using flexbox and using an older method like float is the use ability with float is more difficult then flexbox. You wouldn't be able to center a block of content inside a parent, making children of a box all the same height and width and making columns the same height across the page. 

2) By being able to use flexbox in CSS, it makes writing frontend code easier with practice. being able to target mutiple properties in diffeferent containers will make coding easier.
