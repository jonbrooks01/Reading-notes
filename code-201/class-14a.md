# Class 14a Reading Notes

## Psychological Safety 

1) key factors that play into psychologically safe teams are allowing everyone to speak and feel like an equal in the conversation, take into consideration how other groups members feel, and have a common goal to achieve.

2) When in a work setting, new employees would join the group and at first everyone would be quiet and not say much so that nobody offends the new person or says anything that could be interpreted wrong. After a while though the new person starts talking to the group and everyone starts to open up more and begin to loosen up and become more comfortable with one another, allowing others to joke and enjoy working together.

3) Teams that have a higher degree of psychological safety, often will perform better and produce higher results then teams that don't have the same level of psychological safety.
