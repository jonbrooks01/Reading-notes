# Growth Mindset 

My interpretation on growth mindset is being able to take on challenges without Avoiding the hard parts. Being able to get out of the "same old same old" style of living and embrace the obstacles that come with new challenges.

Starting this class is going to take a lot of **growth mindset**, being able to come out of the shell of mindless day in and day out and finally being able to take on new challenges and be able to achieve my goals not only in this class but for what comes in the future. 

## Reminders for staying on track
 - ***Focus on the end goal***
 - ***Ask for help instead of lose focus***
 - ***Learn from others and share the knowledge***
