# Class 08 Reading Notes

## Expressions and Operators
An expression is a balid unit of code resolves to a value. two types of expressions are ones that assign values and ones that purely evaluate. All comples espressions are joing by operator, the operators follow an order of precedence unless variables are grouped together within parentheses. Javascript uses both binary and unary operators. a binary operator requiers one operand before the operator and one operand after the operator. the unary operator only requires one operand either before or after the operator.

Comparison operators take variable and compare them to one another for equality or for inequality. The results would be displayed in a boolean "true/false" statement.

### What i want to learn
-  How to use the different types of expressions 
- What do some expressions represent 
## Loops

A for loop will continue endlessly unless the specified vaule is false, however a while loop will repeat until the condition evaluates false. both "for" and "while" loops will always repeat unles there is a break in the statement that stops the loop from continuing 

### What I want to learn
- how to effectively use a for/while loop without it continuning forever
