# Choosing an Editor

Choosing a text editor can seem daunting, there are so many out there with different functions and options. They can be as simple as Microsoft word or Apple Pages. However they can be as complicated as Sublime text or Brackets. 

The difference between these editor are how responsive they are to user input. Some just let you type without any input, however there are some that let you code faster by pre-filling information.

Whatever editor you chose will depend on your preference and how you want to control how you code!
